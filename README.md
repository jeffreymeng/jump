# Jump
A strongly-typed programming language designed for writing high-quality code quickly.

Note: Jump is a work-in-progress toy programming language. It takes a lot of inspiration 
from typescript (the good parts) and a bit of python (the parts that I can bear).


### Syntax Examples

```typescript

let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9];

for i in nums.filter(n => n % 2 == 0) {
	print(i ** 2)
}


```
